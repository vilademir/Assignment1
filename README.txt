Bugs:
My program only reads lowercase letters and doesn't include uppercase

When the program asks for a second input, if you type "yes" and then give a
  file that doesn't exist, a mini bug occurs. However, after it will take you to
  the command line so you can input another txt file if you do ./tester "name of file"
